## ABOUT ME
Hello! I am Rishi Ganguly, welcome to my data science portfolio.

Graduated from the University of Toronto, St. George, attained the Honours Bachelor of Science Degree with a Double Major in Statistics & Economics, and a Minor in Mathematics in June 2023. I have been a Dean's List Scholar at UofT for 2020 & 2021. And was granted the University of Toronto Excellence Award for Research in 2022. Currently, I am in the process of getting a MicroMasters Certificate of Data, Economics, and Development Policy from MITx

In industry, I have almost a year of experience working as a Data Scientist for Bell Canada. In academia, I have 2 years of experience working as a ML/NLP Research assistant on 2 different university research projects with the University of Toronto Munk School of Public Policy, Department of Management. 

I am open to new opportunities in Data Scientist roles! Please feel free to reach out to me via email if you think I would be a great addition to your team! I’d be happy to hop on a video or phone call to talk about my experiences and projects on this portfolio.

## PROJECT OVERVIEWS
Below is a description and brief overview for each data science project!

[1. Data/Statistical Analysis I: Housing Sale Price Analysis](https://rishig883.github.io/data_analysis_1/)<br />
This project explores data from the Toronto Real Estate Board (TREB) on detached houses in Toronto and Missisauga. We will use this dataset to estabilish a multiple linear regression model (MLR) which home buyers can use to predict the sale price of single-family, detached homes. The report settles on the Backwards AIC model for feature selection, and finds location to be the largest swayer of sale price, with the number of bedrooms at second most importance. We also found that taxes does not influence sale price as much as expected. <br />
<br />
**Subject Areas**: Data Manipulation, Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Selection, Statistical Diagnostics <br />
<br />
<br />
[2. Data/Statistical Analysis II: EU Powersector Analysis](https://rishig883.github.io/data_analysis_2)<br />
This project is an investigation into the European Union Power Section and its Clean Energy Status. The data used for this report is from EuroStat, and it investigated the 2019 statistics annual electricity data from 2016 to 2018 on the volumes of electricity that have been produced and supplied at the level of the European Union. The overarching finding was that clean renewable energy production integration is going very well and has progressed in the European Union. With specific findings such as, with 95% probability, the true proportion of EU countries that have met their target in 2018 is between 0.21 and 0.44 based on prior information. <br />
<br />
**Subject Areas**:  Data Analysis, Statistical Analysis, Goodness of Fit Test, Bayesian Credible Intervals, etc <br />
<br />
<br />
[3. Unsupervised Machine Learning: Cross Stitch Creation from Images](https://rishig883.github.io/unsupervised_ml/)<br />
This project is a vignette that covers functions that can be used to execute k-means clustering on images in a streamlines workflow. This tutorial will take you through the script and functions needed to create a cross stich guideline from any image. <br />
<br />
**Subject Areas**:  Unsupervised machine learning, R. <br />
<br />
<br />
[4. Topic Modelling/Textual Analysis: Latent Dirichlet Allocation on FOMC Historical Materials](https://rishig883.github.io/textual_analysis/)<br />
In this project we execute a topic model; latent dirichlect Allocation on the Federal Open Market Committee Historical Materials. These historical materials from the FED cover different areas of monetary policy decision making information. In the end we find 4 topics that are well suited for the Greenbook Historical Materials. The topics are production, lending rates, demand, foreign relations. <br />
<br />
**Subject Areas**: NLP, Textual Analysis, Python, R, Topic Modelling, Data Collection, Data Cleaning, LDA <br />
<br />
<br />
[5. Supervised Natural Language Processing: Agreement LSTM model on Federal Open Market Committee Meeting Transcripts](https://rishig883.github.io/supervised_nlp/)<br />
In this project we will be replicating a 2019 paper by Mikael Apel, Marianna Blix Grimaldi and Isaiah Hull from Sveriges Riksbank (Central Bank of Sweden), titled, “How Much Information Do Monetary Policy Committees Disclose? Evidence from FOMC’s Minutes and Transcripts.” This paper is in the field of central bank communication, monetary policy and machine learning. This paper does not have any scripts attached to it, so we will be intepreting the methedology from the paper to recreate their results. In the end we achieve a result of 72% in-sample accuracy and 63% out-out-sample accuracy, which is very similar to the out-of-sample accuracy as the paper.<br />
<br />
**Subject Areas**: Deep learning, NLP, Text Modelling, Python, LSTM, Classification Models <br />
<br />
<br />
[6. Static Data Visualization: Visualizing Bicycle Theft in Toronto](https://rishig883.github.io/static_data_visualization/)<br />
In this project we will be investigating Toronto bicycle theft crimes with statis data visualization techniques using R. We investigate the seasonality and time patterns of bicycle thefts in Toronto. We also identify neighborhoods with the most bicycle theft cases.<br />
<br />
**Subject Areas**: Data analysis, Data visualization, R, Data cleaning <br /> 
<br />
